// Object -  thing that you want to store and process data about 

// Abstraction - to simplify reality 
// For objects that we want to integrate in our program the important thing is the relevant datas and 
// tasks that we want to perform with those datas 

// Class - a template for creating objects, deifnes the attributes and methods of the obejct
// Class is used to create many objects of the same type, class is sometimes referred to as type
// Each objeect is an instance of a class in the computers memory 
// Instantiation - Creating an object rom a class 

// Encapsulation - hiding data and complexity 
// her şeye erişmemiz gerekmiyor -> private/public keyword'leriyle istediğimiz method ya da attrbute'ları accessible belirliyebiliriz

// Inheritance - a class can erive its methods nd properties from another class

// Polynorphism - a class can implement an inherited method in its own way
